# HackerRank

Started lessons on HackerRank to challenge myself and to learn. My dream is to work as a software developer, I love using C# and would love to work with C#. 

I sorted challenges into folders, each challenge has a link to the problem, solutions are tested on HackerRank website. I commented the code to try and explain how I solved the challenge. 

It is a work in progress, I will keep adding more solved challenges as I solve them.
